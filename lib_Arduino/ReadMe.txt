Embedded_Type is a generic type conversion library for Arduino/Processing/C/C++.
It has been developed mainly for simplifying the process of writing wireless communication
programs on Arduino and Processing. To use it (in Arduino), copy the directory Embedded_Type
to arduino_root_folder/libraries/. Then restart Arduino, goto Sketch->Add Library->
Embedded_Type.
