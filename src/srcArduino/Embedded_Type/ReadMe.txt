Embedded_Type is a generic type conversion library for Arduino/Processing/Java/C/C++.
It has been developed mainly for simplifying the process of writing wireless communication
programs on Arduino and Processing. To use it (in C/C++), simply include the header file
"Embedded_Type.h" in the main code.
