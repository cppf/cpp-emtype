 * Type Library

 */

// When arrays are used with this library, their length
// is indicated with a length field before any array
// data. The size of this length field in bytes can be
// controlled by defining the TYPE_LENGTH_BYTES constant
// before including this library (or by changing it in
// the header file itself).
// 
// The default value of TYPE_LENGTH_BYTES is 1 (1 byte)
// which should be an appropriate value when the application
// is related to working with low-cost embedded devices,
// with limited SRAM capacity

// When "getting" or "putting" values without specifying
// a source or destination, causes this library to make
// use of its internal buffer for fetching or storing data.
//
// "putting" more data than this internal buffer size may
// cause the operation to fail, or even may cause running
// application to crash. When "getting", in addition to the
// above problems, it could also be possible to get garbage
// data.
//
// To avoid all these circumstances, define the value of
// TYPE_BUFFER_SIZE to the maximum utilized size in the
// application (before including this library)
