emType is a generic type conversion library for Arduino/Waspmote/Processing/C/C++. It has been
developed mainly for simplifying the process of writing wireless communication programs on Arduino,
Waspmote and Processing. To use it (in Arduino), copy the file emType.h to your sketch directory and
include it (emType.h) in the main code.
